                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
                        page navigation.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                    </br></br>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                    </br></br>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.

                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"

                    </br></br>
                    <code>
                        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    </br>
                        greetMe("World");
                    </code>
                    Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                    </br></br>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                    </br></br>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                    temp99, and _name.

                <p>
                    You can declare a variable in three ways:</br></br>
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                    <code>var x = 42.</code>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</br></br>

                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                    <code>x = 42.</code>
                    This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
                    this variant.</br></br>

                    With the keyword let. For example,
                    <code>let y = 13.</code>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.

                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
                <header>
                    <h2>Variable scope</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                    available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function,
                    it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                    </br></br>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                    within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example
                    the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within
                    which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.

                    <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                    <span style="display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0px">
                        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                    </span>
                    <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                        not defined</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
                    window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                    </br></br>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
                    frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                    declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                    identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
                    dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>

                    <li>same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                    <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                </ul>

                    Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else
                    clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
                    <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
